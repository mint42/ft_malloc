# FT_MALLOC

ft_malloc is a recreation of the malloc dynamic allocation library. This includes the functions malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free(). It expands on the concept of memory management by learning how to maintain a process' heap. ft_malloc is a systems project in the 42 curriculum.

## Getting Started

ft_malloc uses my 42 library which has been included as a git submodule. To set up this project, run `git clone https://github.com/mint42/ft_malloc` in the folder of your choice. Next, from the root of the ft_malloc repository run `git submodule update --init libft` to import the contents of the libft repository. Finally you can run `make` which will use the Makefile to build libft, and then the malloc library.
