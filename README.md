# FT_MALLOC

ft_malloc is a recreation of the malloc dynamic allocation library. This includes the functions malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free(). It expands on the concept of memory management by learning how to maintain a process' heap. ft_malloc is a systems project in the 42 curriculum.

## Getting Started

To set up this project, run `git clone https://github.com/mint42/ft_malloc` in the folder of your choice. You can then run `make` in the root of that repository which will use the Makefile to build the library.
